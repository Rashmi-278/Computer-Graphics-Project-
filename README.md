# Computer-Graphics-Project
An OpenGL menu driven program implementing simulation of dispersion of light and wave super imposition.

Our project Dispersion of light and  Wave Superposition using OpenGL aims to provide a visual representation 
of the working of the Dispersion of light and wave superposition. Our program provides a menu to allow the user to .
There are options which provide the user a choice between the 2 phenomenon. On choosing  Wave Superimposition ,
user can directly input the parameters required for the formation of wave which further results into the formation of superimposed wave.
 
The program requires a GPU to process its graphical computations, a keyboard and a mouse for inputs. 
The user uses a menu function to choose between options to display the desired phenomenon. 
On right clicking, the menu can be displayed
